										<h1>Learning Insights: Visualization Exercise on 
										</br>	[DP-900T00A-Azure-Data-Fundamentals Datasets] 
										</br>with Power BI 🎯📊🔍</h1>
									</header>

										<h3>Dataset Overview 📂📈🔬:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Three data source were provided and accessed with ‘get data from web’ to load and transform the datasets [customers, orders, products]. 
										Using the query editor the datasets were transformed further by creating dimensions tables [product category, country]; practicing the 
										process of creating dimensions from datasets to transform a relational model from a star schema to snowflake.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/dp900-3.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>While exploring the ‘orders’ table, I noticed the unit prices for each product was not provided; the ‘product price’ column was added 
										using a ‘add custom column’ feature and using a division of ‘revenue’ column with ‘quantity’ column.
									</p>

									<!----->

									<header class="major">
										<h3>Data Exploration & Visualization 🔍📊🎨:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The visuals selected for visualization: Card, Card(new), Line Chart, Gauge, Matrix and Filter. 
										It is important to have filters/slicers for interactive visuals.
										To present the insights on facts such as: Sales, Average Sales, Number of Orders, Number of Customers and Number of Products; 
										the ‘card’ visual was used and formatted as preferred.
									</br>
										For an insight into orders over period of time, line chart was used; likewise for insight into sales by product category. 
										Each of the line charts were also analyzed with the categorical field (legend) using ‘country’.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/dp900-4.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>To present: maximum and minimum sale record, max. selling product, customer name with max. sale; the card(new) was selected from 
										the visuals because it provided a multi-card feature.
									</p>

									<header class="major">
										<h3>Key Findings & Interpretation 💡📌📉:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>There is a significant difference is recorded sales in the United Kingdom (UK) compared to the United States (US), largely contributed by the drop in 
										orders received from the US over the period of time, also the sales and orders generated in the “Touring-, Road-, Mountain- Bikes” product category.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/dp900-5.PNG" alt="" /></span>																	
									<p>The highest selling product is “Touring-100 Blue, 60” by summation of sales record; a product from within the Touring Bikes product category. 
										Similarly, the customer with highest total sales is “Terry Eminhizer”; however, “Touring-100 Blue, 60” and “Terry Eminhizer” do not account for the highest single sale record.

										<h3>Technical Walkthrough🛠️📑⚙️:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Returning the customer name and product name with highest total sales was a challenge with litte knowledge in DAX. 
										I was able to search online for solutions and found a written step that worked; and I crossed-check using a table to compare the outcome.
										</br>
										Below is a copy of my DAX written to create the measures to return customer name and product name with highest total sales:
										</br>
										— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
										</br>
										Max Sales by Customer =</br>
										VAR _maxX = MAXX(VALUES(customers[Name]), CALCULATE(SUM(orders[Sales])))</br>
										VAR _tempTable = SUMMARIZE(customers, customers[Name], “@Revenue”, SUM(orders[Sales]))</br>
										VAR _result = CALCULATE(SELECTEDVALUE(customers[Name]), FILTER(_tempTable,[@Revenue] = _maxX))</br>
										RETURN _result
										</br>
										— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
										</br>										
										Max Sales by Product = VAR _maxX = MAXX(VALUES(products[ProductName]), CALCULATE(SUM(orders[Sales])))</br>	
										VAR _tempTable = SUMMARIZE(products, products[ProductName], “@Revenue”, SUM(orders[Sales]))</br>	
										VAR _result = CALCULATE( SELECTEDVALUE(products[ProductName]), FILTER(_tempTable,[@Revenue] = _maxX))</br>	
										RETURN _result
										</br>
										— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
										</br>

										<h3>Conclusion & Next Steps 🎯🔭📌:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The exercise was a helpful in practicing my learnings and skills using PowerBI. 
										An alternative to creating ‘dimensions’ is ‘hierarchy’, but a opportunity to practice dimensions creation to practice data cleaning and 
										transformation was likewise interesting.
										</br>
										For future improvements, I will put consideration on the choice of visuals for situations when a single page report is needed.
										</br>
										You can reach out to me with thought on which visuals that could prove useful for further insight on this analysis for my learning.
